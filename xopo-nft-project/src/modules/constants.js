Holding $XOPO tokens grants artists valuable voting rights, empowering them to shape the future direction of our platform. This democratic approach ensures that every voice counts, creating a fair and inclusive environment.

    When artists mint an NFT, they receive $XOPO tokens, which unlock their voting power within the platform. This innovative system encourages active participation and rewards community involvement. Our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), consisting of $XOPO token holders, plays a pivotal role in maintaining a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem where all participants have an equal say.
    
    In the DAO, collective decisions are made through a robust voting process. Once the voting is complete, the tokens used for voting are burned, symbolizing the consensus reached. Furthermore, each minted NFT generates both unique artwork and tokens, ensuring that the creative output and $XOPO tokens are intertwined.
    
    These tokens serve as a powerful incentive, motivating and recognizing the contributions of our engaged community members. By holding $XOPO tokens, individuals have the opportunity to shape the destiny of Xopo while being rewarded for their active involvement.
    
    Join us on this exhilarating journey, where $XOPO tokens empower artists, foster community engagement, and drive the future of NFT innovation.
